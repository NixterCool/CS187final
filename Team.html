                <h2>Nikolai Yinger</h2>
                <p>This is the creator of the idea of modular web-hosted databases. This Idea came to him while he was on a plane, and he needed to come up with a way to quickly run reports on employee's work efficiency. The only way he could do that with the current database, was to export data from the company database as excel spreadsheets, and then organize the data in a productive maner. The idea came instantly. "What if there was a way to build your own database without actually going through all of the difficult processes of learning sql and programming. What if there was an online hosted database where all of the functionality is chosen by the client company?
                </p>
                <h2>Tyler Torrey</h2>
                <p>Tyler was the first team member to join. He was in the same class with Nikolai, and one day they were talking about ideas for projects to implement over the course of studying computer science. A few ideas were bounced around, but Tyler really liked the idea of a web-hosted modular database. With his existing experience in programming, he joined the team, and it was not officially the beginning of a brand new company. </p>
